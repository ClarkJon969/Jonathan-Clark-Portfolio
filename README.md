#Jonathan Clark's Portfolio  
  
This is my ongoing portfolio project. In it viewers are able to see my Github repositories, my contact information, and are able to learn about me. Projects and other information about myself will be added. The goal of the portfolio is to allow perspective employers to learn more about my skills and finished projects in a hope that I could be a potential asset to their company.
